QA Verification based on CN RAC(mutiple databases): 
-------------------------------------- 
Environment: 
------------ 
ip-range: 192.168.11.101~105
host Level 2 credential: vzpbdna/bdna 
oracle Level 3 credential: bdnadisc/bdna 
Databases and instances: 
1. ora12c -> ora12c1, ora12c2
2. oradb  -> oradb1, oradb2
3. orcl   -> orcl1, orcl2
-------------------------------------- 

Instruction: 
------------ 
Test case 1 (to reproduce the issue): 

1. Install old Enterprise Sequence. (the Enterprise Sequence provided to customer for test last time.)
2. install the LMS License key. 
3. new a scan against the following ip-range(192.168.11.101~105) at level 2 & level 3 for Oracle Database. 
(The related credentials are provided in the above 'Environment'.) 
4. refresh the report. 
5. review the report for Databases -> Oracle DB Instances on UI, as the screenshot showed: 
   a. instanceNameNotCorrespondingToRightDBName.bmp

Test case 2 (to validate the updated code) 
1. Install 2016-09 Enterprise Sequence. (the code in qa branch on github).
2. install the LMS License key. 
3. new a scan against the following ip-range(192.168.11.101~105) at level 2 & level 3 for Oracle Database. 
(The related credentials are provided in the above 'Environment'.) 
4. refresh the report. 
5. review the task summary and LMS report on UI, as these screenshots showed: 
   a. 1_cnRacWith3dbsTasks.bmp 
   b. 2_cnRACNodes.bmp
   c. 3_cnRacWith3dbsLmsData.bmp
   d. 4_cnRacWith3dbs_name.bmp
   e. 5_cnRacLmsInstanceName.bmp
   f. 6_cnRacLMSOptionsName.bmp
   g. 7_cnRacLMSOptionQuery.bmp

Note: 
----------
screenshots For test case 1 are attached to the Attachement.
screenshots For test case 2 are packaged into screenshots20160923_cnRACwith3DBs.zip, please download it from the attachment to review, thanks! 

As the test Environment is in China GZ office, QA can try to access it through VPN connection. If QA can't access this environment, we need Erroll's help to add 2 more databases in his RAC invironment so that QA can finish the verification smoothly.
